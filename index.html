    <h4>In this extract, the writer introduces anothre man. His<br> presence creates tension and helps the reader <br> understand how Adam feels about the wrold in which <br>he has found himself</h4>
    <h2>First Paragraph</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The writer focusses on visual descriptions of the man and the valley.</li>
        <li>The use of silhouette adds mystery and dnger as the amn's features cannot be seen.</li>
        <li>The word 'waiting' makes it sound as though the man has intent and may be threatening.</li>
        <li>The gloom of what looked like a dead end makes the alley sound dangerous as he could get trapped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Second paragraph</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Adam prepares to fight bu says he was clutching at straws. This means that it is a hopeless situaion and that, although he will try his best, fighting is not likely to be sucessful</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Third and final paragraph</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Adam feels relieved as he realises he has been imagining the danger. His relief turns into embarrasment as he feels foolish for panicking</li>
        <li>It means that he felt slightly deflated and let down by the realisation that the danger was in his imagination. This shows that he seems to enjoy the thrill f an adventure</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Tension</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The tension starts to build in the first line on 'and stopped'. This shows Adam is suddenly tense as he sees the man silhouetted. The tension then continues to build as he thinks he could get trapped and cannot see anything to defend himself.</li>
        <li>The tension is released in paragraph 3 when he realises that the man is not even looking down the alley. It then deflates completely when he realises he's 'an old guy'.</li>
        <li>The tension building then decreases making the story more exciting as the reader is drawn in then shares his relief.</li>
    </ul>
